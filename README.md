The ray tracer displays a scene containing a table with various other objects on or around the table including a cake made from cylinders, a cake topper in the form of an octahedron made from 8 small planes, and a globe made from a textured sphere and a cone base which has been illuminated by a spotlight. The back wall is made from a plane textured with an image of a brick wall.
